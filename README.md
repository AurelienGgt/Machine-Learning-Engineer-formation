In this Formation, I completed a series of 7 projects.

-----------------------------------------------------
Project 1: Design an Application for Public Health:
-----------------------------------------------------


The agency "Santé publique France" launched a project call focused on food-related issues. You will propose an application based on nutritional data.


-----------------------------------------------------
Project 2: Predict the Energy Consumption of Buildings:
-----------------------------------------------------


To reach its goal of becoming a carbon-neutral city by 2050, the city of Seattle needs your help. Your mission? Predict the electricity consumption of municipal buildings.


-----------------------------------------------------
Project 3: Segment E-commerce Website Customers:
-----------------------------------------------------


You are a consultant for Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce site. The marketing teams need to segment their customers to optimize communication campaigns.


-----------------------------------------------------
Project 4: Automatically Categorize Questions:
-----------------------------------------------------


On the Stack Overflow site, users post questions related to computer science. Your task is to develop a system that automatically tags user questions.


-----------------------------------------------------
Project 5: Classify Images Using Deep Learning Algorithms:
-----------------------------------------------------


An animal welfare association wants to automate the identification of its residents from photos. This is an opportunity to use deep learning models, which are very effective at image classification!


-----------------------------------------------------
Project 6: Develop a Proof of Concept:
-----------------------------------------------------


Data Science is constantly evolving, and you must stay up to date with developments. In this open project, you will conduct research on the state of the art to develop a proof of concept (POC).

In this project, I used the results from Project 6 to compare with Visual Image Transformers and determine which result would be the best for our analysis.


-----------------------------------------------------
Project 7: Participate in a Kaggle Competition!
-----------------------------------------------------


For this final project, your Data Scientist skills will be tested… You will participate in the Kaggle competition of your choice. May the force be with you!

For this project, I chose the "Disaster from Titanic" competition to analyze the Titanic disaster and detect the types of people who would have survived based on their sex, social rank, etc.
